                                                    FUNCTIONALITY TESTING
                                                  *************************
DEFINITION:-
  -> Testing each and every components thoroughly against the requirement specification we call it as functionality testing.
  -> Components means textbox,radio button,checkbox,links etc...
  -> Thoroughly means by entering all the valid and invalid datas.
  -> Functionality testing is done by test engineers.

THREE WAY'S OF FUNCTIONALITY TESTING:-
  - Over Testing.
  - Under Testing.
  - Optimization Testing.

1.OVER TESTING:-
  -> Testing the application with same set of scenarios again ans again is know as over testing.

  DISADVANTAGES OF OVER TESTING:-
  -> They may leads to wastage of time.

2.UNDER TESTING:-
  -> Testing the application with insufficient of scenarios we know as under testing.

  DISADVANTAGES OF UNDER TESTING:-
  -> We may miss the certain defects.

3.OPTIMIZATION TESTING
  -> Testing the application with sufficient of scenarios we know as Optimization testing.

  ADVANTAGES OF UNDER TESTING:-
  -> We may identified more no.of defects in a short term period of time.

HOW DO WE DO NUMBER EACH AND EVERY LINE OF REQUIREMENTS:-
  -> They communication becomes very easy 
  -> It is easy to understand
  -> We will get a better clarity
  -> It becomes traceable
